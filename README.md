> This project relates to a Bike Sharing company who wants to know how what are the parameters impacting the bike booking


## Table of Contents
* Bike Sharing User case
* Python and sklearn libraries
* Variables impacting bike booking

<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information
- Linear Regression Model for Bike Demand
- The Business goal here is to build a Regerrsion model by introspecting the data of a Bike sharing company and understand which variables influence more demand for bikes.
- The Dataset being used is historical data of bike booking pre-covid

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Temperature (Temp): It's clear that temperature has a bearing on bike booking. Warmer temperature is preferred by customers - the company should launch some offers when the weather is good
- Year: Year 2019 shows much better sales than 2018. This implies that post pandemic, customers would be keen to use bike for commuting
- Season: Summer and Fall season are preferred by customers.
- Weather: Customers avoided bad weather as in snow/rain as opposed to clear/cloudy weather.
